        <h2>Refund Policy â€“ the basics</h2>
        <p>
            Having said that, a Refund Policy is a legally binding document that is meant to reassure customers that they can request refunds, while explaining how refund requests are handled. It should address issues like timelines, conditions under which refunds are granted, and other information that provides customers with peace of mind. Adding friendly practices, such as timelines for refunds and how customers can file for a refund, is a great way to inform consumers that they are valued and their concerns are prioritized.

        <h2>What to include in the Refund Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Generally speaking, a Refund Policy often addresses three types of issues: the timeline for accepting refund requests, the method and condition under which refunds are processed, and much, much more.
