        <h2>Privacy Policy â€“ the basics</h2>
        <p>
            Put very simply, a Privacy Policy is a statement that discloses some or all of the ways a website collects, stores, discloses, protects, and manages the data of its visitors and customers. It should include the purpose and methods with which data is collected and used, practicing transparency and honesty regarding who accesses or handles it and the mechanisms for visitors to understand options or protections available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Different jurisdictions have different legal obligations that must be included in a Privacy Policy. You are responsible for reviewing your own obligations and relevant legislation to your activities and location.

        <h2>What to include in the Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Generally speaking, a Privacy Policy often addresses three types of issues: the types of information the site or business collects, how it manages those interactions, and how it protects them. You may choose to include the following details here:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>What information you collect, how, and why.</li>
            <li>How you use the information.</li>
            <li>How users can contact you regarding their data or privacy rights.</li>
            <li>Any third-party services your site uses and their policies.</li>
            <li>Additional mechanisms related to data management or deletion.</li>
        </ul>
