        <h2>Shipping Policy â€“ the basics</h2>
        <p>
            Put very simply, a Shipping Policy is a legally binding statement that is meant to reassure users that their items are on their way. It outlines a legal framework for protecting customers against shipping issues such as delivery delays, lost or damaged items, or any other disruptions that happen outside of their control.
        </p>
        <p>
            A Shipping Policy is a good place to add helpful notes and friendly practices for customers. You might consider listing shipping methods or rates here. For instance, you may need to explain how long delivery will take and how you handle lost or delayed shipments. Be sure that users can easily understand your shipping/return/exchange policies.
        </p>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What to include in the Shipping Policy</h2>
        <p>
            Generally speaking, a Shipping Policy often addresses three types of issues: the timelines for processing orders, the shipping carrier, different domestic and international shipping options, potential service interruptions, and much, much more.
