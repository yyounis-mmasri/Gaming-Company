        <h2>Terms & Conditions â€“ the basics</h2>
        <p>
            Having said that, Terms and Conditions (T&Cs) are a set of legally binding terms defining how you, as the owner of this website, offer services. T&Cs inform the legal boundaries governing the activities of this website and its users, while helping you set the proper rights and responsibilities between your business and your customers.
        </p>
        <p>
            T&Cs should be edited according to the specific needs of each website. For example, a website offering products to customers in e-commerce transactions may require different amendments to its T&Cs than a website solely providing information (like blogs, e-learning, and so forth).
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>What to include in the T&C document</h2>
        <p>
            Generally speaking, T&Cs often address three types of issues: Who is allowed to use the website; the policy against unauthorized duplication of the website content; any charges for use; differing practices for data governance; or where proper guidelines may be referenced for intellectual property or copyrights.
